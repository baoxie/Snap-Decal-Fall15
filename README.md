Snap Final Project
Team members: Bao Xie, Liza Praprotnik, and Megan Carey

We added a text stamp feature to the sprite paint editor. We worked in paint.js.
<p>Details:
Choose the no-icon tool, then click/drag on the canvas. Once activated, you will be prompted 
to enter a text message. Upon finishing, the text will be converted into an image on the canvas 
(whereever you initially clicked). Moreover, the user is able to click on other parts of the 
canvas to "stamp" the text.
